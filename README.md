# Personal Scripts
Scripts I created for my own personal use to make commands quicker and more convenient.

For example, the newrepo command creates a new github repository on my local desktop and online. At the same time the command configures the repository by adding a README.md and a .gitignore, and sets the remote origin. 

The MyWireshark.app folder is actually a short script made in AppleScript and turned into a .app file so that I can open Wireshark with sudo priveleges. This was created to fix the issue of not being able to monitor any traffic by opening the Wireshark app normally without sudo access. The error fixed by this app is:<br>
<code>"You don't have permission to capture on that device"</code>
